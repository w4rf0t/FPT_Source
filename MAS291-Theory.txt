Suppose a 95% conf‌idence interval for population mean turns out to be (1000, 2100). To make more useful inferences from the data, it is desire to reduce the width of the conf‌idence interval. Which of the following will result in a reduced interval width? | Increase the sample size.
The random variable X represents the number of credit cards that adults have along with the corresponding probabilities. Find the mean and standard deviation. | mean: 1.18; standard deviation: 1.30
A golfer would like to test the hypothesis that the variance of his golf score equals 120. A random sample of 25 rounds of golf had a sample standard deviation 4.6. The test statistic for this hypothesis test would be: | None of the other choices is true
Two white mice mate. The male has both a white and a black fur-color gene. The female has only white fur-color genes. The fur color of the offspring depends on the pairs of fur-color genes that they receive. Assume that neither the white nor the black gene dominates. List the possible outcomes. W = white and B = black. Create the sample space of possible outcomes. | WW. BW
The correlation coefficient between variables X and Y is positive and close to 1. The relationship between the variables X and Y is_________ | a strong linear relationship and as X increases, Y increases
Assume that human body temperatures are normally distributed with a mean of 98 (degree F) and a standard deviation of 0.5(degree F). Describe the sampling distribution for the sample mean body temperature of 50 selected persons. | Approximately normal with a mean of 98(degree F) and a standard deviation of 0.07(degree F)
A ________ is a portion ofa population that is representative of the population from which it is selected. | parameter
